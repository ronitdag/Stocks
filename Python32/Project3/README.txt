Obectives: Using Python and libraries in Python that help 
dowload information from the interenet in real time and make 
correct stock market predictions using the algorithm 
the professor had given us. In addition to this, minimum
error-checking was required, which was done through many 
try and except statements for the most part. 

Tools Used: Knowledge of Python 3.2 was used. 

Challenges: It was hard to understand list indexing, 
and simply connecting all the pieces of the project 
together. Once that was done though, everything fell into 
place. This was a cool project. Make sure to follow the 
UI instructions and not to go too far back when it comes 
to typing in dates for company taglines.
